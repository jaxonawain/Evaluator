This project is to create an evaluator that will take an equation and return the result.

The equation should be able to take +, -, *, / as operators. Should follow the basic rules of PEMDAS. Things that should
not be supported are:

- Double Operators
- Back to Back Parenthesis (such as '(xx)(xx)'
- Variables
