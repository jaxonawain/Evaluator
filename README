This project is to create an evaluator that will take an equation and return the result.

The equation should be able to take +, -, *, / as operators. Should follow the basic rules of PEMDAS. Things that should
not be supported are:

- Double Operators
- Back to Back Parenthesis (such as '(xx)(xx)'
- Variables

This project is simply for fun. I am working on exploring more about the Python language.

The process should be broken into a few items:

Validation
- Use the validation class to create an object using an equation, and push it through each rule defined in that class.
If none of the rules are broken, the equation will be passed back out into the main program.

Parsing
- Use the parser class to parse the validated equation into a dictionary of steps.

I need to work on this.

Evaluation
- Use the Evaluator class to evaluate the parsed equation and return a single value.
   - step throught parsed list and find open paren
   - Record through open paren till found close paren
   - If found open paren, restart process
